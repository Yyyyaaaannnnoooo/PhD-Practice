core values related to freedom

> "Our values at YouTube are based on four essential freedoms: Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Information, Freedom of Opportunity, and Freedom to Belong"
>
> "As you begin your journey on YouTube, it’s important to **be authentic**. Viewers are more likely to connect when they see you’re passionate about the topic."
>
> ## How does YouTube identify content that violates Community Guidelines?
>
> With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale. Machine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content we’ve already removed, even before it’s viewed.
>
> We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge. Our Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue.
